# 36. On the number of column families

> HBase currently does not do well with anything above two or three column families so keep the number of column families in your schema low. Currently, flushing and compactions are done on a per Region basis so if one column family is carrying the bulk of the data bringing on flushes, the adjacent families will also be flushed even though the amount of data they carry is small. When many column families exist the flushing and compaction interaction can make for a bunch of needless i/o (To be addressed by changing flushing and compaction to work on a per column family basis). For more information on compactions, see [Compaction](https://hbase.apache.org/2.2/book.html#compaction).

HBase 目前不能很好地处理超过两或三列族的内容，所以**尽量减少列族的数量**。

flush 和 compactions 是基于一个 Region 操作的，所以当一个具有大量数据的列族被 flush 时，它临近的列族也会被 flush，即使它只有很少的数据量。

大量的列族执行 flush 和 compactions 操作会产生没必要的 IO 负载。

> Try to make do with one column family if you can in your schemas. Only introduce a second and third column family in the case where data access is usually column scoped; i.e. you query one column family or the other but usually not both at the one time.

**尽量设置一个列族**。

只有在数据访问仅限于列时，引入第二个和第三个列族。例如，在一个时间，查询一个列族，或其他的列族，而不是同时查询这些列族。

## 36.1. Cardinality of ColumnFamilies*

> Where multiple ColumnFamilies exist in a single table, be aware of the cardinality (i.e., number of rows). If ColumnFamilyA has 1 million rows and ColumnFamilyB has 1 billion rows, ColumnFamilyA’s data will likely be spread across many, many regions (and RegionServers). This makes mass scans for ColumnFamilyA less efficient.

当一个表中有多个列族时，要清楚其基数 (如，行数)。

如果列族A有1百万行，列族B有1亿行，列族A的数据会分布在许多许多 regions (and RegionServers) 中。这会导致对列族A的大量的扫描，这会很低效。
