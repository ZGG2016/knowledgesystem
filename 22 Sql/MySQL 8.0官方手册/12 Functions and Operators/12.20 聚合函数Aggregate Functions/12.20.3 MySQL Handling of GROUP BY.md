# 12.20.3 MySQL Handling of GROUP BY

<font color="grey">SQL-92 and earlier does not permit queries for which the select list, HAVING condition, or ORDER BY list refer to nonaggregated columns that are not named in the GROUP BY clause. For example, this query is illegal in standard SQL-92 because the nonaggregated name column in the select list does not appear in the GROUP BY:</font>

SQL-92 及更早版本不允许这种查询：

```sql
SELECT o.custid, c.name, MAX(o.payment)
  FROM orders AS o, customers AS c
  WHERE o.custid = c.custid
  GROUP BY o.custid;
```
